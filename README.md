# Anti-Social Media Platform

How do we break into the over-saturated market of social media platforms? :thinking: Simple. Appeal to the one demographic overlooked by the very nature of social media: **the anti-social**. :sunglasses: What if there existed a platform where people could show off how anti-social they really are? Video games clearly demonstrate that competitiveness overrides anti-social nature. So, by getting people to compete in their anti-social habits, we can gain access to a previously untapped market.

This project will use React.js as the front-end and Spring Boot as the back-end with a MySQL database to store user info. :grinning:
