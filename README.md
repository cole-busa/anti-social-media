# Anti-Social Media Platform

How do we break into the over-saturated market of social media platforms? :thinking: Simple. Appeal to the one demographic overlooked by the very nature of social media: **the anti-social**. :sunglasses: What if there existed a platform where people could show off how anti-social they really are? Competitive video games are a prime example where the urge to compete overtakes one's anti-social nature. Therefore, by allowing people to display their anti-social habits like TV hours watched or singleplayer video games completed, we can gain access to a previously untapped market.

This project uses React.js as the front-end with Axios for REST requests and Material UI for premade components. The back-end consists of Spring Boot alongside a MySQL database to store user info. :grinning:

TODO: Add movie lists, TV show lists, and video game lists for each user to search from and display. Calculate a total anti-social score that shows at the top of their profile.
